# Graph ADT

## Overview

This program demonstrates the use of the Abstract Data Type (ADT) for graphs. With the power of Graph ADT, we aim to provide an efficient and intuitive method to manage and manipulate graph structures in various real-world applications.

## Features

- **Node Management**: Easily add, remove, and query nodes.
- **Edge Management**: Establish relationships between nodes with weighted or unweighted edges.
- **Traversal**: Perform both depth-first and breadth-first traversals.
- **Pathfinding**: Find the shortest path between nodes using algorithms like Dijkstra's or A*.
- **Visualization**: Get a visual representation of your graph.

## Getting Started
