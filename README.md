# Graph ADT 🌐

## Overview 🌟

This program, developed by Pablo Seijo García at the University of Santiago de Compostela (USC), demonstrates the use of the Abstract Data Type (ADT) for graphs in C. The Graph ADT is designed to provide an efficient and intuitive approach for managing and manipulating graph structures, crucial in various real-world scenarios such as network design, route optimization, and more.

## Features 🛠️

- **Node Management** 📊: Facilitates the addition, removal, and querying of nodes.
- **Edge Management** 🌉: Allows establishing relationships between nodes with options for weighted or unweighted edges.
- **Traversal Algorithms** 🔍: Supports depth-first and breadth-first traversals to explore graph structures.
- **Pathfinding** 🚀: Implements algorithms like Floyd-Warshall for finding the shortest, fastest, or most economical paths.
- **Minimum Spanning Tree** 🌳: Includes Prim's algorithm to find the minimum infrastructure of connections to keep cities connected.
- **Interactive Console** 🖥️: User-friendly console interface for real-time graph manipulation and analysis.
- **Visualization** 📈: (If applicable) Offers a graphical representation of the graph structure.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have `GCC` or a compatible C compiler installed.
- Basic understanding of graph theory and C programming.

### Installation 📥

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/pabloseijo/TADGraph.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
```
cd TADGraph
```

3. Compile the program:
```
gcc -o graph main.c TADs/funciones.c TADs/grafo.c
```


### Usage 🖱️

1. Run the compiled program:
```
./graph grafo.txt
```

2. Follow the interactive prompts to manipulate the graph.
